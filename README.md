# 2D Platformer

This is my implementation for the modified 2D Platformer game project for the course Game Design and Development by Michigan State University.

**Major Modifications:**

1) Design two (2) new enemies with slightly altered appearances but completely new mechanics/behaviors.

2) Add new environmental mechanic: auto-expanding acid pool.

3) Design two (2) new levels with various challenges (i.e. puzzles and/or enemies).

**Minor Modifications:**

1) New mechanic: trigger utility to initiate events (e.g. when go into a designated zone).

2) New mechanic: change camera's view's size.
